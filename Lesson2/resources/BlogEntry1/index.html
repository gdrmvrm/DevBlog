  <h1>Web Development Journey</h1>
  <h3>First Entry</h3>

  <p>I am a Transportation Engineer and have spent a third of my life working on congestion
    issues and providing solutions to traffic problems in a few different countries.  Outside
    of my profession, I have always held an interest in photography.
    In the process of putting my photographs out there, I managed to figure out how to set up a wordpress
    account but then I thought why not build something all on my own.  This is my blog about learning to code and
    my journey into creating a cool photography website that will get me out there one day.</p>

    <p>I came by a <strong>Freelance Website Development</strong> course on <em>Codecademy</em>.  This <em>Pro</em>
    course is one of their paid courses (about $200) for a period of ten weeks.  Below I have listed  some of
    skills which will be thought on this course.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Git and Command Line</li>
        <li>Responsive Design</li>
        <li>Bootstrap, JavaScript, Jquery</li>
      </ol>

  <p>This blog entry is my way of keep track of what I have learnt so far.</p>

  <h2>Lesson 1 - HTML</h2>
  <p> Here is a list of all the tags I have learnt so far:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set up a boilerplate HTML code</li>
      <li>Basic tags such as:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Paragraph</li>
          <li>Bold</li>
          <li>Italics</li>
          <li>list in bullets and numbers</li>
          <li>link image and video file</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
