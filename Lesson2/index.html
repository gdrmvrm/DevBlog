  <h3>Entry No 2</h3>

    <strong>Date: 7 June 2017</strong>
  </p>

  <Div>
    <p>From my first entry on 29 May 2017 to now, I have learnt quite a lot. I have
      now a <em>basic</em> understanding of CSS and how to change font sizes and use
      different fonts. I have understood the difference between "class" and "ID".
      More importantly, I have created a few projects that are being thought on
      Codecademy <em>Pro</em>. </p>

  <Div class ="list">
    <p>Here a list of items I have used in making the blog post</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Linking CSS to HTML</li>
      <li>Inserting videos and images</li>
      <li>Hyperlinking sheets.</li>
      <li>Use of CSS elements</li>
    </ul>
  </Div>

  <P>I thought it might be a good idea to show you a snapshot of how my blog has evolved,
    granted it is only the second day. But this is how my blog looked on

    post atleast a couple of blogs per week!</p>
